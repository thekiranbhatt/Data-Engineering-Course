Week 3 Assignment — Q5
Student: Kiran Bhatt

Complete the load_batch() function below.

Requirements:
  - Load a list of trip dicts into the trips table
  - All rows must load inside a SINGLE transaction
  - If ANY row fails, roll back the entire batch (no partial commits)
  - Log what went wrong (which row, what error)
  - Return the number of rows loaded (0 on failure)
  - Never silently swallow errors — re-raise after rollback

The connection boilerplate and INSERT SQL are provided.
You write the body of load_batch() and main().

Test your function with:
  1. A clean batch of 5 rows — should commit and return 5
  2. A batch where row 3 has rating=99 — should roll back and return 0
     Verify: the DB row count is unchanged after the failed load.

""" Changes and updates to the file
Updated the SQL target columns to passenger_id and payment_method_id 
to match my Week 2 database names instead of the draft template. Since 
the assignment data passes the varchar "cash" into an integer column, 
an inline SELECT subquery was added. 
Furthermore, added conn.commit() immediately after the first row count 
query to close the implicit background transaction and prevent driver 
set_session state crashes.
